# MashThemUp

This web app helps DJs to find songs that would make a geat mash-up. After choosing the first song, DJ can choose the BPM range and the app will display other tracks within the given BPM range and in the key that would match the chosen track.

The app is based on the Spotify API so it's needed to be logged in to a Spotify account in order to use the app.
